# [Name of Game] Proposal
- " MATCH MAKER "

## What is [name of game]?

 - Different types of memory games have always been my favorite to play , this
 is why I'am choosing to do it . Especially because I get to be on the other side
 making up the rules and creating the game .

## Initial thoughts on game structure

 - Using the DOM for this game is probably going to be one of the biggest challenges 
 that I feel I'm going to uptake because I'm still trying to really get an understanding of it.


## Phases of Completion

- 

(The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)
